#### Features of insertion sort:
 - As insertion sort has less overhead than divide-and-conquer sorting algorithms, it performs better on small inputs than quick/merge sort
 - The running time for (nearly) sorted array is linear
 - The running time for (nearly) sorted in reverse order array is quadratic
